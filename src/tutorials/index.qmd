title: "NHANES Tutorials"
---

This series of tutorials are intended to introduce the NHANES
Epiconnector project to data analysts and students working with
NHANES data.

[NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm) is an
ongoing Health and Nutrition survey conducted by the United States
CDC. Most individual-level data from the survey are publicly available, making it a rich
resource both for epidemiology research and education.

NHANES is a complex survey that uses multi-stage sampling and
intentionally oversamples certain population subgroups. This makes
analysis of NHANES data somewhat nontrivial: Naive statistical
estimates such as the sample mean and regression coefficients will be
biased for their population counterparts. Even though this can be
resolved by using the selection weights provided by CDC, naive
estimators of the _standard error_ will still be biased unless one
takes into account clusters and PSUs used in the sampling
design.

Another common issue one needs to account for is related to
questionnaire administration and data missingness: Question B may be
skipped depending on the answer to question A, but this information is
_not_ recorded in the response to question B, except to say that the
response is missing. To distinguish such missingness from genuine
missingness, one needs to understand the flow of the questionnaire.

Another set of challenges arise when we wish to combine data across
NHANES cycles. Combining data across cycles gives a larger sample
size, which naturally improves inference. However, not all information
is collected in all cycles, and sometimes the specific details of what
information is collected and where it is available changes.

The main challenge for analysts and students new to NHANES data is
navigating how the data and documentation can be accessed. The CDC
distributes these from their website, using the SAS transport (XPT)
format for coded data, and HTML files for documentation. These are
both non-standard formats for most modern data analysis tools, and
some preliminary work is required to process these inputs and extract
usable data.

The tutorials below try to address these issues systematically, using
an R based workflow. They are meant for users comfortable with R but
new to NHANES data analysis, as well as those interested in
alternative workflows.


# Tutorials

- [Introduction](nhanes-introduction.html) --- A brief introduction to
  the NHANES project and how it makes data and documentation available
  to the public.

- [Accessing NHANES Data Locally](nhanes-local.html) --- R
  based tools that make it possible to access NHANES data locally,
  reducing the overhead of downloads.
